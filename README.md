## Introduction

The U.S. States Guessing Game Quiz is a Python-based project that tests your knowledge of the 50 states in the United States. 
It presents a blank map of the U.S. with a timer and prompts you to guess the names of the states. You can enter the name of a state, and if you're correct, 
it will be filled in on the map. The game keeps track of your score, and the challenge is to guess all 50 states as quickly as possible.
